About Us

At DeWaldt Consulting and Contracting (Pty) Ltd, we specialise in delivering precision fit-outs, renovations, and facilities maintenance and management for retail, corporate, residential, and mission-critical environments. Based in Gauteng, South Africa, we bring world-class standards to every project - ensuring spaces are completed on time, on budget, and with zero disruption.

What We Do

We partner with clients to transform interiors into functional, high-performance spaces that reflect their brand and purpose. Whether it’s a residential upgrade, retail flagship, corporate office, or high-security data centre, our approach combines technical expertise, meticulous project management, and a deep respect for craftsmanship.

From initial consultation to final handover, we provide end-to-end delivery - managing every phase with precision and accountability.

Our Approach

We believe in zero-disruption delivery, ensuring business operations continue seamlessly during construction. Our clean-build protocols maintain dust, noise, and waste control to the highest standards, while our single point of accountability gives clients total clarity and confidence from start to finish.

We combine traditional craftsmanship with a fresh, forward-thinking approach - applying proven international experience to deliver spaces that are both practical and inspiring. With a strong portfolio and a commitment to quality, we’re ready to bring your project to life with efficiency, transparency, and care.

Our Story

Our founder, Jan “JD” Jordaan, built his expertise in New Zealand, where he managed projects across multiple sectors - including luxury retail and flagship stores, corporate offices, gyms, hospitality venues, and data centres. His hands-on leadership and global experience set the foundation for DeWaldt Consulting and Contracting’s standards today: excellence, integrity, and precision.

Now established in South Africa, JD and his team continue to apply those same international best practices to deliver results that meet - and exceed — expectations.
